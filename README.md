#About Project
Help students understand and resolve conflicts when merging branches.
Help students practice creating new branches and merging them back into the main branch.
You and a colleague are working on the same file in two different branches. After both of you commit changes on your respective branches, you will merge the branches and resolve any conflicts that arise.
